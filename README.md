Automated Report Cleanup
Old reports are automatically cleared before each test run to prevent clutter.
Serve Reports Locally
The HTML reports generated by Mochawesome can be served locally for easy viewing.
Jenkins Integration for CI/CD
Continuous Integration (CI) setup with Jenkins for automated test execution.
Prerequisites
Node.js installed.
Cypress installed.
Mochawesome reporter installed.
rimraf for report cleanup.
http-server to serve reports locally.
Jenkins CI tool installed.
Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install project dependencies:

How to Run Tests
1. Running Smoke Test Suite via CLI
To run the smoke test suite using the Chrome browser, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --browser chrome --spec ".\cypress\e2e\smoke-tests\" --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options reportDir=cypress/reports,overwrite=false,html=true,json=true
2. Clearing Old Reports
Before running new tests, clear old reports using the following command:

bash
Copy code
rimraf .\cypress\reports\
3. Serving Reports Locally
After generating the report, serve it on localhost using:

bash
Copy code
http-server ./cypress/reports
Then, navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the reports.

4. Loading Base URL from .env
The base URL is loaded from the .env file into cypress.config.js to manage environment-specific settings. Ensure your .env file is correctly configured.

Running Tests in Jenkins CI
