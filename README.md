How to Run Tests
1. Running Smoke Test Suite via CLI
To run the smoke test suite using Chrome browser, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress run --browser chrome --spec ".\cypress\e2e\smoke-tests\" --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options reportDir=cypress/reports,overwrite=false,html=true,json=true
2. Clearing Old Reports
Before running new tests, clear old reports using the following command:

bash
Copy code
rimraf .\cypress\reports\
3. Serving Reports Locally
After generating the report, serve it on localhost using:

bash
Copy code
http-server ./cypress/reports
Then, navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the reports.

4. Loading Base URL from .env
The base URL is loaded from the .env file into cypress.config.js to manage environment-specific settings. Ensure your .env file is correctly configured.
